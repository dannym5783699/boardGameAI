Project Description:
- This starts a hexapawn type of game with a computer player.
- The computer player will have a move that caused them to lose removed so they get better and learn.
- There are three different modes
- Slow mode allows you to choose moves for the computer and shows each move at the bottom.
- Fast mode is a normal game against the computer.
- Auto mode is a computer against a computer where you can enter how many games and see the results at the end.
- You can select rows, columns, and player colors.

Possible Issues:
- In auto mode it seems like player one eventually runs out of moves and loses every time at about 50 games.
- Moves should be properly removed when encountering an empty box.
- With larger boards it is hard to see the possible moves and chances.

Notes:
- I was told that I could receive some extra points for adding the ability to change rows, columns, and colors.
- Rows and Columns do not need to be the same and any color but transparent will work.
